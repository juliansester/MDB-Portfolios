# Abstract
Sovereign loan portfolios of Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs) typically consist of only
a small number of borrowers and are therefore heavily exposed to single name concentration
risk. Based on realistic MDB portfolios constructed from publicly available data, this paper
quantifies the magnitude of the exposure to name concentration risk using accurate Monte
Carlo simulations. By comparing the exact adjustment for name concentration risk with its
analytical approximation as currently applied by a major rating agency, we further investigate
whether current capital adequacy frameworks for MDBs are overly conservative. Finally, we
discuss the choice of appropriate model parameters and their impact on measures of name
concentration risk
